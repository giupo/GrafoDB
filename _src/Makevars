## Use the R_HOME indirection to support installations of multiple R version

ext=./../ext
PKG_CPPFLAGS= -I$(ext)/include

## As an alternative, one can also add this code in a file 'configure'
##
## PKG_LIBS=`${R_HOME}/bin/Rscript -e "Rcpp:::LdFlags()"`
##
## sed -e "s|@PKG_LIBS@|${PKG_LIBS}|" \
## src/Makevars.in > src/Makevars
##
## which together with the following file 'src/Makevars.in'
##
## PKG_LIBS = @PKG_LIBS@
##
## can be used to create src/Makevars dynamically. This scheme is more
## powerful and can be expanded to also check for and link with other
## libraries. It should be complemented by a file 'cleanup'
##
## rm src/Makevars
